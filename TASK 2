Document Object
        The Document object represents the HTML content of a web page. It is essentially an interface to the web page's structure and content, allowing developers to access and manipulate the elements within the HTML document.
Represents the HTML Document: 
         The Document object represents the entire HTML document and provides access to all its elements, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

Hierarchical Structure:
         HTML documents have a hierarchical structure, and the Document object reflects this structure. It allows you to navigate through the DOM (Document Object Model) tree, moving from one element to another.

Accessing Elements:
         Developers can use the Document object to access and modify elements within the HTML document. Common methods include getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and getElementsByTagName.

Content Manipulation:
        You can use the Document object to add, delete, or modify content on a web page. This is particularly useful when dynamically updating a page with JavaScript.

Global Scope: 
       Variables and functions declared in the global scope are attached to the Window object. This means that they can be accessed from any script running in the web page.

Browser-Related Functionalities:
       The Window object provides access to various browser-related functionalities, such as opening new windows or tabs, resizing the window, navigating to URLs, and interacting with browser history.
